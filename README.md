# week3project

This repository contains working files from a math 381 project in which we were tasked with optimizing mortality function constants. we chose to assess both an exponential model and the Gompertz-Makeham model. optimize.py finds optimal constants, visualize.py shows information about the curvature of the error function across the parameter space, and robustin is a file which assesses the robustness of our evaluation by applying our algorithm to subsets of the original dataset, fuzzing the dataset on the x axis, or fuzzing on the y axis. Our algorithm was a simple coordinate subdivision of the parameter space, which has the disadvantage of inefficient operation but doesn't run the risk of getting stuck on local optimums, scales to N dimensions without changes to the code, and would lend itself well to GPU acceleration.
